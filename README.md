## Installation

### C2 Server

1. **Navigate to the `C2_Server` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd C2_Server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Bot

1. **Navigate to the `Bot` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update the C2 server URL in `bot.py` (replace `<C2_SERVER_IP>` with the C2 server's IP address).**

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

### AI Model

1. **Navigate to the `AI_Model` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd AI_Model
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model and generate the `phishing_model.pkl` file:**

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
